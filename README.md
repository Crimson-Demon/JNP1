# JNP1
A repo for my jnp1 course work and projects.
JNP1 stands for Języki i Narzędzia Programowania 1 i.e programming languages and tools.
The aim of the course was to learn advanced C++ programming.
There were 7 projects, one new project every 2 weeks.
Except for the last project, all of them were done in pairs or groups of three.
Topics covered were:
-STL data structures and algorithms
-value and reference semantics
-smart pointers, RAII
-exceptions
-template specialisation and overloading, variadic templating, template metaprogramming
-dynamic polymorphism
-functors, function pointers and lambdas;
